    <h1>Shaky Shaky Maracas</h1>
    
    <p>We are a start up company new to the maraca selling game. We are growing fast and in a few years we hope to be the leading maraca supplier in the          Midwest, and then the United States. No other maraca supplier can match the quality of our maracas. They are hand-painted and show supreme craftsmanship.     For more information about how our maracas are made, visit our <a href="process.html">How Our Maracas Are Made</a> link. We even have a specially made        maraca that is indestructible. We ran these maracas over with a car and they still wouldn't break.</p>
